# oranges
how to play:
a random number is chosen from 1-20, and then the orange that has the number, is called
the orange has to respond, and it has a 1/15 chance to not do so. IF they dont, they're out, and the round starts again
if you are the one who was called, clcik on any orange within 3 seconds. If you don't, GAME O V E R

once 4 oranges are left, you are no longer able to see the ones that are still in the game, and they appear as dead, to inconvenience you :sunglasses:
public url will be up once done :D
